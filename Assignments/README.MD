### Storage Classes

1. Write a program to demonstrate the behavior of the auto storage class. Create a function that declares an auto variable, modifies it, and prints its value. Call the function multiple times and observe the output. Using static Storage Class

2. Write a program that demonstrates the difference between a global static variable and a local static variable. Modify and print their values inside different functions to see how their scopes and lifetimes differ.

3. Create a program with functions that declare variables with different storage classes. Demonstrate how scope and lifetime affect variable access within and outside of functions.

### Bitwise 

1.    
    + Write a program to find out whether a user entered integer is even or odd.(Use bitwise AND)

    + Print an appropriate message on the console.

    + Use testing of bits logic

2. Determining Even or Odd Using Bitwise OR

3. W.A.P to set(make bit state to 1) 4th and 7th position of a given number and print the result

4. W.A.P to clear(make bit state to 1) 4th and 7th position of a given number and print the result.


# DS
### Assignment 1
1. Given a matrix A of size m x n, write a function that returns the sum of elements below the main diagonal, i.e those elements aij for which i>j

2. Create a linked list ADT with functions for insertion, deletion, traverse forward, traverse reverse, searching for an element, reversing a list and also test the above functionality. 

3. Develop a program to add two polynomials using linked list implementation for polynomials

4. Given two sorted lists, L1 and L2, write a procedure to merge L1 and L2 and generate a third list.

5. Develop a self-adjusting list using linked list. A self-adjusting list is like a regular list, except that all insertions are performed at the front, and when an element is accessed by the Find, it is moved to the front of the list

6. Implement doubly linked list ADT

7. Create a Stack ADT using array implementation and solve the following

    - Balancing symbols

    - Evaluation of postfix expression

    - Converting Infix to postfix

8. Create a Stack ADT using linked list implementation.

9. Implement Linear Queue ADT using linked list implementation.

10. Implement Circular Queue ADT using array implementation.

11. Implement Deque ADT using doubly inked list. Deque is a data structure in which insertions and deletions are performed only at the ends.

### Assignment 2

1. Implement the following searching techniques.

    - Sequential Search
    - Binary Search

2. Implement Selection Sort, Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Quick Sort, Merge Sort and Heap sort algorithms. 
3. Create a hash table of size 11 which maintains keys of integer type. Resolve the collisions using separate chaining. Also include functionality to print the elements hashed into each of the slot in hash table. 

4. Construct Binary Search Tree (BST) ADT class and include functionality to insert an element, delete an element, inorder traversal, preorder traversal, postorder traversal, mirror image of BST, height of BST, count number of nodes of BST and level-wise ordering of BST. 

5. Given inorder and preorder sequences of a binary tree, construct the binary tree. 6. Implement file system using trees
